## Input commands to MTR

<dl>
  <dt><code>/ST</code></dt>
  <dd>Status. Will make the MTR send a status-message (see xxx for protocol description)</dd>

  <dt><code>/SA</code></dt>
  <dd>Spool all data in MTR2. No Polling will be done! This will send messages of type xxx until all stored e-card readings is sent.</dd>

  <dt><code>/SBxxxx</code></dt>
  <dd>Spool Binary. Spool all data from package# xxxx (LSB) and to on /NS â€“ New session</dd>

  <dt><code>/GBxxxx</code></dt>
  <dd>Get message binary. Will send a single data-message from history. The MTR will continue "polling" for e-cards during data sending, with short dealy for receipt. Least significant byte first.</dd>

  <dt><code>/SCymdhms</code></dt>
  <dd>Set clock. The 6 bytes are binary values for current time:

  <dl>
  <dt>y</dt>
  <dd>year: values accepted are 90 to 99 (1990..1999) and 0 to 53 (2000..2053) </dd>

  <dt>m</dt>
  <dd>month: values accepted are 1 to 12</dd>

  <dt>d</dt>
  <dd>daynumber: values accepted are 1 to 31</dd>

  <dt>s</dt>
  <dd>second: values accepted are 0 59</dd>
  </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>/CL</code></dt>
  <dd>Clear Ringbuffer. Will clear all history (and reset package counters!)</dd>

## Message description

An MTR message is an e-card reading, and have the following format:

| ------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1-4     | preamble        | (4 0xFF never occur "inside" a message, this can be used to resynchronize logic if a connection is broken)                               | 0xFF         | 4               |

All bytes must be XOR-ed with OD (255 - 32).

## Status message

A status message message is the response for a `/ST` command to the MTR, it has
the following format:

## ASCII-string in MTR message

The 56 ASCII bytes sent from e-card will have the following info (only in
on-line mode! Offline all blank!).

NOTE: This ASCII string i reprogrammable, so no assumption should be made that
the following data will remain correct for future versions of e-cards.

### New e-cards (manufactured after summer 1998 with green/amber casing)

Example: `"EMIT EPT SYS VER 2 DISP-1 S0059P0136L0004 "`

<dl>
  <dt>S0000</dt>
  <dd>The S-field indicates the number of disturbances/noise that woke up the e-card but was not recognized the signal</dd>

  <dt>P0000</dt>
  <dd>The P-field indicates the number of "tests/readings". A test is when e-card is made put to sleep by MTR or 250-control within approx 4 minutes from beeing waken-up.</dd>

  <dt>L00000</dt>
  <dd>The L-field indicates the number of events when e-card was awake for more than approx 4 min.</dd>
</dl>

### Old e-cards (yellow)

Example: `"REGNLY TRACK RECORDING SYSTEM DISP-1 DISP-2 DISP-3 "`
